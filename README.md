# Codetree

Codetree is a tiny web-base code playground scale for speed of execution, using esbuild, typescript and React, unlike codepen.io or codeSandbox, the code is compiled directly in web browsers, without backend and converted into machine language, allowing extremely fast execution and off-line use of the editor.

Current features

- Instant compilation of Js/Css/Html code and preview (10x faster than codepen/codesanbox).

- Import of npm modules and Es6 support (Ex: `import React from "react").

- Auto-completion and intelliSense of Html, Css, Js code during typing. 

- Off-line use.
