# Codetree

Codetree is a high efficiency and lightning fast ⚡️⚡️⚡️ code playground supporting automatic module detection in the import syntax (es6/es5).Unlike https://codepen.io/ or https://codesandbox.io/ , Codetree is built on top of using esbuild, the code is compiled directly in web browsers, without backend and converted into machine language, allowing extremely fast execution and offline mode.

## Usage

No need to install any npm package manually, codetree automatically detects the presence of import/require syntax in your file, downloads and installs npm package for you, for example just type `import React from "react"` for installing React library.

## Features

- Instant code compilation and preview (15x faster than codepen/codesanbox).

- Automatic import of external library.

- Auto-completion and intelliSense.

- Offline mode.
